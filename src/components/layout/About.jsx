              My name is <span className="text-accent">Chiamaka Uyanna</span>, a
              frontend developer who loves turning code into beautiful,
              functional experiences. I can’t pinpoint exactly what sparked my
              interest in frontend development, but there’s something exciting
              about writing code that transforms into applications that people
              actually use and enjoy.

              Over the years, I’ve worked mostly with startups, helping them
              bring their ideas to life through clean and engaging frontend
              experiences. While freelancing has been my main gig, I’ve had the
              chance to collaborate with different teams and projects,
              constantly learning along the way.

              <span className="text-accent font-medium">React Native</span> to
              build mobile applications, and I’m loving the challenge! My go-to

              I’m a big believer in keeping an open mind and exploring different
              perspectives. Whether in code or in life, I think there’s always
              something new to learn when you step outside of your comfort zone.

              When I’m not coding, you can probably find me on a volleyball
              court, enjoying a good game.
